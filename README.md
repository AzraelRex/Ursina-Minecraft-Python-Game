# Ursina-Minecraft-Python-Game
Hello my name  is Azrael Rex Anacleto, and this is one of my first ever python game projects coming off right after my Python quiz and planet game.


I had made this game utilizing the Ursina game engine.


Feel free to fork or clone this game as it is presently in its earliest stages and needs plenty more of input and features. Though please give credit to me if you were to do so. 
Happy coding lads.
